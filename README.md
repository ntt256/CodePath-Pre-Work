## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Facebook Messenger
*Customizable notification sound through the app 
*Can require Face ID to open the app 

2. iMessages
*Being able to preview messages by tapping and holding the conversation 
*Being able to pin conversations 

3. Photos (app)
*Requires Face ID when accessing Recently Deleted and Hidden folders 
*Can separate shots into different folders such as screenshots, selfies, videos, etc...

4. Notes 
*Can lock a note which requires a password 
*Can scan documents 

I would like to improve on an existing app: iMessages. I would like to add a feature where the user can require Face ID or a passcode when opening the app. This feature is specifically for security purposes. The passcode could even be the same passcode that the user enters when turning on their iPhone. This feature would be similar to the app, Facebook Messenger, has a feature where the user can enable Face ID requirement when opening the app.  

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Challenges I faced... 
*First figuring out how to use XCode and finding where the UI editor was because the settings was set on Multiplatform when creating the project 
*Had a bit of trouble figuring out where the last 2 lines required by the Pre-Work instructions on where to put it in the code
*Took a bit of time to try to find where the important buttons/features were on XCode
